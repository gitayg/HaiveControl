# HaiveControl

**A hive of your machines, one AI mind.** Self-hosted, LAN-first remote control with a
built-in **MCP interface** — so an AI (Claude, etc.) can see the screen, run commands,
and move files across a whole fleet of devices from one place.

![license: AGPL-3.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-AGPL--3.0-blue)

A tiny single-file tool for **your own machines** (Windows, macOS, Linux). One binary
runs on each target: it streams the full screen, accepts mouse + keyboard control, runs
shell commands, and transfers files over HTTPS. Drive it from **any browser**, a CLI,
or an **MCP-enabled AI** — nothing to install on the viewing side.

> View + control + a remote command box. **LAN-only, hub model:** the Mac runs a
> small hub with an ID; you launch the Windows exe with just that ID; it finds the
> Mac over Bonjour and registers itself. This is a real remote-admin agent — see
> **Security** below.

## How it works

```
  Mac:      HaiveHub                 → prints  "Mac ID: itays-macbook-pro"
  Windows:  HaiveControl.exe itays-macbook-pro
                 └─ finds the Mac by that id (Bonjour), registers itself,
                    then serves screen + control + shell on port 8765
  Mac:      open the hub dashboard  → the Windows box is listed → click to view
```

The only thing you configure on Windows is **one argument: the Mac's ID**.

## Built in Rust

HaiveControl is a Rust workspace producing four small, dependency-free binaries:

| Binary | Role | ~size |
|---|---|---|
| `HaiveControl` | agent (runs on each device) | 5 MB |
| `HaiveHub` | hub (runs on the Mac) | 3 MB |
| `haivectl` | CLI (Mac) | 5 MB |
| `haive-mcp` | MCP server (Mac) | 6 MB |

**Build from source:** `cargo build --release` → binaries land in `target/release/`.

**CI builds all three platforms.** `.github/workflows/build.yml` runs a
**Windows + macOS + Linux** matrix (`cargo build --release`) and attaches all four
binaries per OS to the release:

- Tag a release: `git tag v1.0.0 && git push --tags` → e.g. `HaiveControl-windows.exe`,
  `HaiveControl-macos`, `HaiveControl-linux`, plus the `HaiveHub-*`, `haivectl-*`,
  `haive-mcp-*` sets.
- Or run the **build** workflow manually (workflow_dispatch) → download from Artifacts.

Nothing to install to *run* them — they're static native binaries.

### Platform notes (runtime)
- **Windows** — works out of the box. The C runtime is **statically linked**
  (`+crt-static`), so no Visual C++ Redistributable is required (no `VCRUNTIME140.dll`).
- **macOS** — the agent needs **Screen Recording** and **Accessibility** permission
  (System Settings → Privacy & Security). Unsigned binary: right-click → Open the
  first time to clear Gatekeeper.
- **Linux** — needs an **X11** session (Wayland unsupported by the capture/input
  crates). Build deps: `libxdo-dev libxcb1-dev libx11-dev libxtst-dev`.

## Step 1 — start the hub on the Mac

Run `HaiveHub` (`./HaiveHub-macos`). It prints your **Mac ID** and a dashboard URL, e.g.:
```
Mac ID:  itays-macbook-pro
Dashboard: http://localhost:8770/
On Windows run:  HaiveControl.exe itays-macbook-pro
```
Keep it running. Both machines must be on the **same LAN**.

## Step 2 — run the agent on the target

**The hub hosts the binaries**, so the target downloads and runs in one line — no manual
copy. The dashboard shows a ready-made, per-OS command with a copy button. It downloads
the file as **`airm`** and registers it. For example:

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell or cmd) — works in both
curl.exe -L -o airm.exe http://MAC_IP:8770/bin/HaiveControl-windows.exe
.\airm.exe MAC_IP:8770 --id itays-macbook-pro
```
```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -L -o airm http://MAC_IP:8770/bin/HaiveControl-macos && chmod +x airm
./airm MAC_IP:8770 --id itays-macbook-pro
```

The target can be given by **direct IP** (`MAC_IP:8770`), by **Mac ID** (Bonjour
`--id`), or both (IP first, Bonjour fallback). Append a **password** as a final argument
to require auth. After registering, the agent prints **`ready`**. The first run triggers
a **firewall** prompt — allow it on private networks.

### Staying current
The agent **auto-checks the hub for a newer build every 2 minutes** and self-updates in
place. You can also push an update on demand from the dashboard (**Update**) or MCP
(`update_agent`) — the agent replaces its own executable and relaunches with the same
arguments.

### Lifetime modes
Pick how long the agent sticks around (default = one-time):

| Mode | Flag | Behaviour |
|------|------|-----------|
| One-time | *(none)* | Runs until you close it. Nothing installed. |
| Persistent | `--persist` | Installs autostart so it comes back on every boot. |
| Timed | `--ttl MIN` | Runs for `MIN` minutes, then exits and removes any autostart. |

```bat
HaiveControl.exe mymac secret --persist       :: survives reboot
HaiveControl.exe mymac secret --ttl 30         :: self-dissolves after 30 min
HaiveControl.exe --uninstall                   :: remove autostart, exit
```

Autostart uses the **standard, visible** mechanism per OS — Windows `HKCU\…\Run`,
a macOS **LaunchAgent** (`~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.haive.agent.plist`), or a
Linux XDG **autostart `.desktop`**. Nothing hidden; `--uninstall` (or deleting that
entry) removes it. "Dissolve" stops the process and clears autostart — it does **not**
delete the binary (self-deleting executables are a malware pattern, intentionally
avoided).

## Step 3 — connect from the Mac

Open the hub dashboard (`http://localhost:8770/`). The Windows machine appears in the
list — click it. The dashboard link uses **https** (see below). If a password was set,
the browser shows a login prompt (username can be anything, password = the one you
passed); otherwise the live screen opens directly. No IP to look up.

> Password can also come from the `SCREEN_PW` env var — the 2nd CLI argument just
> overrides it, so it's easy to bake into a Startup shortcut.

## HTTPS (on by default)

The agent serves over **TLS** using a self-signed certificate it generates on first
run (stored in `~/.haive/` on the Windows box, so it's stable across restarts).
Traffic — screen, keystrokes, password, command output — is encrypted.

Because the cert is self-signed, the first time you connect the browser shows a
**"Not private / not secure"** warning. Two options:

- **Quick:** click *Advanced → Proceed*. You're now on an encrypted connection.
- **No more warnings:** copy `~/.haive/cert.pem` from the Windows box to the
  Mac, open it in **Keychain Access**, and set it to *Always Trust*. The lock goes
  green for that machine.

Set `SCREEN_TLS=0` to fall back to plain HTTP if you'd rather not deal with the cert.

## Using it — the hub dashboard

The dashboard is a single-page console: a **device sidebar** on the left, a **stage** on
the right. Pick a device and everything happens in place — no new tabs. The sidebar
polls every few seconds so status dots (online / idle / stale) and last-seen stay live
without reloading (an active stream keeps playing).

Per selected device you get its details (OS, CPU, memory, user, IPs, cameras, mics),
**live CPU-load and free-RAM meters** (re-sampled every cycle), and an action bar that
renders results **in the stage viewport**:

- **● Live screen** — the full screen streams live (MJPEG).
- **● Cam live** — live webcam video. A **camera picker** chooses which camera; the
  same picker feeds **Camera shot**.
- **Screenshot** / **Camera shot** — a single fresh frame.
- **Run…** — enter a single command; stdout/stderr print to the inline console.
- **Shell** — a full **interactive terminal** (xterm.js over a real PTY): colors,
  `Ctrl-C`, arrows, tab-completion, `top`/`vim`, live resize.
- **Get file / Put file** — a remote **file browser** to download or upload.
- **Update** — hot-update this agent to the hub's latest build.
- **Dissolve** — stop the agent and remove its autostart (does not delete the binary).

Uploads land in `SCREEN_SHARE` (or the user's home dir if unset); with `SCREEN_SHARE`
set, browsing/downloads are confined to that folder (`..` is blocked).

Each device in the sidebar has a **🤖 icon** — click it to copy a ready-to-paste block
that sets up the MCP for that device (the `claude mcp add …` line with the hub URL, your
`MCP_TOKEN`, and your owner pre-filled) plus a few example prompts. Hand it to your AI agent
and it can drive that machine.

## Run commands from the Mac (API + CLI)

Everything the browser does is a plain HTTP API on the agent, so you can drive a
device from a script. Two ways:

**`haivectl` (recommended)** — resolves the device through the hub by name, so you
never type its IP:

```bash
haivectl list                          # list registered devices
haivectl exec mymac "ipconfig /all"    # run a command, print output
haivectl get  mymac C:\logs\app.log    # download a file
haivectl put  mymac ./patch.zip C:\tmp # upload a file
```
Global flags come **before** the subcommand: `--hub` (default `http://localhost:8770`),
`--password` (if the agent set one), `--cafile` (agent `cert.pem` to verify TLS).

**Raw API** (talk to the agent directly; `-k` because the cert is self-signed):
```bash
curl -sk -u :SECRET https://DEVICE_IP:8765/exec \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"cmd":"whoami"}'
```
Returns `{"ok":true,"code":0,"stdout":"…","stderr":"…"}`. Other endpoints:
`GET /download?path=…`, `POST /upload` (multipart `file`, optional `dir`).

## Use it as an MCP server (drive devices from an AI)

The `haive-mcp` binary wraps the same API as MCP tools, so an AI client (Claude Code,
Claude Desktop, etc.) can operate a device by name. Tools exposed:

- `list_devices()` — registered devices, with full details (OS, CPU, memory, logged-in
  user, IPs, cameras, microphones, last-seen)
- `screenshot(device)` — the current screen as an image
- `camera_snapshot(device, index?)` — a still from a connected webcam (pick which with `index`)
- `run_command(device, command)` — run a shell command, get output
- `click(device, x, y)` / `type_text(device, text)` / `press_key(device, key)` — drive mouse + keyboard
- `download_file(device, remote_path, save_as?)` / `upload_file(device, local_path, remote_dir?)`
- `update_agent(device)` — hot-update the agent to the hub's latest build
- `dissolve_agent(device)` — stop the agent and remove its autostart

Live video (screen and camera) streams as MJPEG in the browser dashboard; it isn't an
MCP tool because a stream isn't a single tool response — use `screenshot` /
`camera_snapshot` for AI-driven stills.

### One MCP server, many devices
The hub tracks every registered agent, so a single `haive-mcp` controls them all —
just run the agent on each device with the **same Mac ID**. They each register and you
target them by name: `run_command("linux-box", …)`, `screenshot("macmini")`. Give each
a clear label with `--name` (or `SCREEN_NAME`) so they're easy to tell apart:

```bat
HaiveControl.exe mymac secret --name reception-pc
```

Runs on the Mac next to the hub. Register the binary:

```bash
claude mcp add haive -- /full/path/to/haive-mcp
```

The MCP drives devices **entirely through the hub's `/m` API** (it never talks to an
agent directly), so the same setup works for LAN *and* cloud/relay devices. Config via env
(set in your MCP client, or export before launch):
- `HAIVE_HUB` — hub base URL (default `http://localhost:8770`; a cloud hub's `https://…`).
- `HIVE_MCP_TOKEN` — token for the hub's `/m` API (must match the hub's `MCP_TOKEN`).
- `HIVE_OWNER` — the owner id to act as, so a multi-user hub scopes tools to your devices.
- `HAIVE_CAFILE` — optional PEM to verify a self-signed hub cert.

Then just ask: *"take a screenshot of mymac"*, *"run `ipconfig` on mymac"*,
*"download C:\logs\app.log from mymac"*.

**Against a cloud hub (crane.glick.run):** set `MCP_TOKEN` on the hub and add `/m` to
`auth_bypass_paths` (a headless MCP can't pass SSO — same reason as the agent). Then point
the local MCP at it with `HAIVE_HUB=https://<app-url>`, `HIVE_MCP_TOKEN=<token>`,
`HIVE_OWNER=<your-email>`. The MCP runs on your Mac; only its HTTP calls to the hub cross
the network.

## Reverse-tunnel relay (control beyond the LAN)

The default model is **pull**: the hub reaches *into* each device at its IP. That only
works when the hub can route to the device — same LAN. To control devices **across NAT**
or from a **cloud-hosted hub**, run the agent in **relay mode**: it dials *out* to the
hub and holds the connection, and the hub drives it back down that channel. The device
never needs a public address.

```bash
HaiveControl <mac-id> --relay https://your-hub.example.com     # cloud hub
HaiveControl <mac-id> --relay http://192.168.1.10:8770         # or any reachable hub
```

- The tunnel is **HTTP long-poll on the hub's normal port** (`/relay/hello`, `/relay/poll`,
  `/relay/reply`) — no extra port, no WebSocket — so it rides a single HTTPS endpoint.
  Every action (screenshot, live video, shell, files, update, dissolve) works over it:
  the agent satisfies each request by calling its own loopback server and streams the
  result back.
- Relay devices show up in the dashboard like any other, tagged `relay`, with live
  CPU/RAM.

### Deploy the hub on AppCrane (crane.glick.run)

The repo ships a `Dockerfile` + `deployhub.json` that build the hub from source and bake
in the current agent binaries (served at `/bin/*`). The hub reads `PORT`, exposes
`/api/health` → `{status, version}`, and — when `HUB_PUBLIC_URL` is set — shows relay-mode
install commands in the dashboard. Recipe:

A **headless agent can't pass SSO** (no browser, no login), so the agent-facing paths must
be SSO-bypassed — and the hub then authenticates the agent itself with a shared token.

1. Create the app from this repo (custom Dockerfile is auto-detected).
2. Set env / secrets:
   - `HUB_PUBLIC_URL=https://<your-app-url>` — makes the dashboard show relay-mode install
     commands (add a custom domain for a cleaner product).
   - `RELAY_TOKEN=<a long random secret>` — **the agent's credential**; it replaces SSO on
     `/relay`, and the dashboard bakes it into the shown install command.
3. **Bypass SSO on the agent-facing paths** (`auth_bypass_paths=["/relay","/bin","/m"]`;
   add `/m` only if you use the MCP) so
   devices can reach the tunnel + downloads and long-lived connections aren't buffered or
   cut — on AppCrane this sets `flush_interval -1` and zero read/write timeouts. **Keep
   `/x/*` behind SSO** — that's the device-control surface, admin-only. TLS is terminated at
   the platform edge, so the tunnel is encrypted even though it's plain HTTP inside. `/bin`
   serves only public binaries, so it needs no token.
4. Deploy, then on each device run the relay command the dashboard shows
   (`./airm --relay https://<your-app-url> --relay-token <token> --name <device>`).

**Relay auth:** with `RELAY_TOKEN` set, every `/relay/*` call must carry `?tok=<token>` —
the agent sends it (`--relay-token` or `HIVE_RELAY_TOKEN`); wrong/absent → `401`. Unset =
open (trusted LAN / dev). Query-string tokens on bypass paths aren't logged by the proxy.

**Per-user devices (multi-user hub).** When AppCrane forwards the authenticated user
(`X-AppCrane-User-Email`), the hub scopes everything to that user: the device list
(`/agents` + dashboard) shows only devices they own, and device actions (`/x/*`) are
refused (`403`) on devices they don't. Ownership comes from the `owner` a device registered
with — the dashboard bakes `--owner <you>` into the install command it shows, so a device a
user enrolls is automatically theirs. No user header (LAN/dev) = full access, as before.

> The `owner` is self-asserted by the agent, so it's a **visibility/soft boundary** — a
> holder of the shared `RELAY_TOKEN` could plant a device under another owner. Per-user
> relay tokens (token → identity) would make it a hard boundary; a reasonable next step.

## Config (environment variables)

| Var              | Default    | Meaning                                      |
|------------------|------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `SCREEN_PW`      | *(empty)*  | Password. Empty = open (LAN mode); set to require auth |
| `SCREEN_PORT`    | `8765`     | Listen port                                   |
| `SCREEN_FPS`     | `10`       | Frames per second                             |
| `SCREEN_QUALITY` | `60`       | JPEG quality 1–95                             |
| `SCREEN_MAXW`    | `1600`     | Downscale frames wider than this (px)         |
| `SCREEN_MONITOR` | `0`        | 0 = all monitors, 1 = primary, 2 = second, … |
| `SCREEN_EXEC`    | `1`        | Set `0` to disable the remote command box     |
| `SCREEN_TLS`     | `1`        | Set `0` to serve plain HTTP instead of HTTPS  |
| `SCREEN_SHARE`   | *(empty)*  | Confine file transfer to this folder; empty = whole filesystem |
| `SCREEN_NAME`    | *hostname* | Friendly device label shown in the hub (also `--name`) |

## Unattended / start at login
Put a shortcut to `HaiveControl.exe` in the Startup folder
(`shell:startup`), or create a Task Scheduler task "At log on". To pass a password,
point the shortcut at a small `.bat` that does `set SCREEN_PW=… & HaiveControl.exe`.

## Security — read this
- **LAN-only, open by default.** With no `SCREEN_PW`, anyone on the same LAN who
  reaches port 8765 gets the screen, control, **and** the shell. That's fine on a
  trusted home network; on an untrusted/shared LAN, set `SCREEN_PW` and/or
  `SCREEN_EXEC=0`. Don't port-forward this to the internet.
- **`/exec` is a full remote shell** on the Windows box, running as you. Set
  `SCREEN_EXEC=0` to disable it if you only want view + control.
- **Plain HTTP** — traffic is unencrypted. Acceptable on a trusted LAN, which is the
  intended use here.
- **Browser eats some shortcuts.** Combos like Ctrl+W / Ctrl+T are handled by your Mac
  browser before reaching the remote. Use the command box for those cases.
- Intended for **your own devices**. Don't deploy it to watch someone without consent.

## Layout (Rust workspace)
- `crates/agent` → **`HaiveControl`** — the agent (Windows/macOS/Linux): screen capture,
  `/frame`, `/stream` (live MJPEG), `/camera` + `/camstream` (webcam), `/input`, `/exec`,
  `/shell/*` (interactive PTY shell), `/upload`, `/download`, `/list`, `/update`,
  `/dissolve`; registers to the hub and reports full sysinfo + live CPU/RAM. Modules:
  `capture` (xcap + nokhwa), `input` (enigo), `shell` (portable-pty), `tls` (rcgen),
  `discovery` (mdns-sd, self-update), `relay` (outbound long-poll tunnel), `http`
  (which also runs a loopback twin the relay self-calls), `persistence`.
- `crates/hub` → **`HaiveHub`** — the Mac hub: Bonjour advertise, `/register`, `/agents`,
  the single-page dashboard (with a bundled xterm.js terminal at `/assets/*`), hosts the
  agent binaries (`/bin/*`), proxies device actions (`/x/*`, incl. live-stream
  passthrough), and terminates the reverse tunnel (`/relay/*`, see `relay.rs`).
- `crates/cli` → **`haivectl`** — Mac CLI: `list` / `exec` / `get` / `put` by device name.
- `crates/mcp` → **`haive-mcp`** — Mac MCP server: `list_devices` / `screenshot` /
  `run_command` / `download_file` / `upload_file` tools (rmcp).
- `.github/workflows/build.yml` — `cargo build --release` matrix (Windows/macOS/Linux).
